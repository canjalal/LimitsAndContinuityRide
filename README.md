Limits and Continuity Version 1.00

Description

This is a teaching tool to help students learn about the limits and continuity of functions

How to Use
When you load / reload the page, the site will randomly generate a function with four types of discontinuities
randomly placed: jump discontinuities, vertical asymptotes, removeable discontinuities ("holes"), and gaps ("essential discontinuities").

Click a point to open a menu to the right. Then click on one of options on the right. Ashley will then walk on the function to show you
how to visualize that particular feature of the graph. Try to predict the property before Ashley tells you!
