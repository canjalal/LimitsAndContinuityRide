# LimitsAndContinuityRide
An app to explore limits and continuity

Background

Learn about limits and continuity! Given a random function plotted on screen, click any points on the graph to explore the different types of limits and discontinuity.
Think you're ready for a quiz? Click quiz to test whether your predictions are correct! Finally, fix the ride by patching each discontinuity the right way.

Functionality

In Limits and Continuity Ride, users will be able to:

1.) Generate and plot a piecewise continuous function between x = -10 and x = 10, and (excluding near vertical symptotes) y = -10 and y = 10
2.) Be able to request a left-limit check, right-limit check, full-limit check, function defined, continuity. They can also do global checks like
whether a y-value is in the range, and end behavior. All of this will be visualizable.
3.) They can take a quiz to test them on characteristics at a point, receive a score back, and see an animation demonstrating the answer after they've clicked submit,
    which walks them through each answer.
4.) They can customize the function based on how many discontinuities and of which type and any horizontal asymptotes they want.
5.) They can go into game mode where they patch another random function with "bridges" over discontinuities. When they click test, a cart will ride across the screen.
    If it makes it to the other end of the screen, they win, otherwise the cart will fall off and people die.

In addition, this project will include
1.) A splash screen with 3 modes + screen to generate custom function
2.) An instruction screen specific to each mode
3.) Icons of a little person running left / right, looking up / down, icons of a bridge (fixes vertical asymptotes), ramp (fixes jumps), tie (fixes removable discontinuity)
